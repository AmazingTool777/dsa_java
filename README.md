# Data Structures and Algorithms (aka DSA) practice with Java

This is a collection of the basics of DSA using Java that I make **to learn, to practice and also to recall** the
fundamentals of
those concepts. Hopefully, you can find the collection insightful too ðŸ˜‰.

## What to expect in this repository?

This repository **only contains the basics**, it does not contain **_leetcode-style problems_** but rather **simple
demos**
of how to use those basic datastructures.  
I intend to dedicate another repository for those **_leetcode-style problems_** where the focus is on the application of
the knowledge of DSA concepts onto given problems.

## DSA concepts

These are the DSA concepts I plan to incorporate into this collection, but I will continuously add more concepts as I
learn new ones:

- **Queue**
- **Stack**
- **Priority Queue**
- **Graph**: It includes topics like **graph traversals** and **the search for optimal paths**.
- **Sorting algorithms**
- **Trees**
- **Recursion**
- **Dynamic programming**
- **Backtracking**

## Usage

If you plan to get your hands on to the program, for the time being, just explore the java packages at the root where
each package represents one specific DSA concept.  
Now that you are inside one of those packages, run **the main program** that is under the `Main` class.  
Finally, you are good to go. The programs are _console programs_ that you can interact with.
